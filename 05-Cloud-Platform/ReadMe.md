Requirement: 
Use Azure and design a scalable architecture for a microservices-based application. Your design should consider:

- Cost optimization.
This microservice application will be fully hosted in AKS.

This is what the app will do:
allow user login (portal or client facing app)
register users,
perform database requests - read and write data,
validation with external api providers

Deliverable: A detailed architecture diagram and explanation of the components used.
